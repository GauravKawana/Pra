In English:

This robot looks like a small human — it has two arms and moves on two wheels. You can control it wirelessly using your smartphone through Bluetooth, just like connecting to a wireless speaker.

It can move forward, backward, turn left or right, and stop — all with a tap on your phone. Its arms can move up and down to pick up light objects, like a small ball or a toy.

The brain of the robot is an Arduino Nano — a tiny computer that tells all parts how to work. The wheels are powered by two small motors, and a special chip (L298N) helps control their movement.

It’s made for learning — students, teachers, or hobbyists can use it to understand how robots work. Later, you can add sensors (like eyes to detect walls) or even control it with hand gestures!



In Hinglish:

Ye robot thoda insaan jaisa dikhta hai — iske do haath hain aur do pahiyon par chalta hai. Aap apne smartphone se ise Bluetooth ke zariye control kar sakte hain, jaise aap kisi wireless speaker ko connect karte hain.

Ye aage, peeche, baayein ya daayein taraf ghoom sakta hai — bas phone par ek tap se. Iske haath upar neeche hote hain taaki halki cheezein utha sake, jaise koi chota ball ya khilona.

Iska dimaag ek Arduino Nano hai — ek chhota computer jo har cheez ko control karta hai. Pahiyon ke liye do chhote motors hain, aur ek special chip (L298N) unki movement ko control karta hai.

Ye seekhne ke liye banaya gaya hai — students, teachers ya hobbyists sab ise istemal kar sakte hain taaki samajh sake ki robot kaise kaam karte hain. Aage chal ke aap ise deewar dekhne ke liye sensors ya haath hilane se control karne jaise features bhi add kar sakte hain!
